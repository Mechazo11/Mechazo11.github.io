  title: "Multimodal Indoor Positioning Systems and Methods for Privacy Localization."
  venue: University of Louisiana at Lafayette, 2024
  description: >- 
    The disclosed multimodal indoor positioning system combines Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, 
    smartphones, cameras, and edge devices. Smartphones generate location estimates from BLE signals, while cameras provide 2D video frames.
    Edge devices integrate this data, assigning anonymous tracklet IDs to smartphones for precise indoor tracking.

  title: "Exploring the relationship between mobility and COVID− 19 infection rates for the second peak in the United States using phase-wise association."
  venue: BMC Public Health, 2021
  description: >- 
    This study analyzes the phase-wise, non-linear relationship between human mobility 
    and COVID-19 case growth post-lockdown, finding limited predictive value overall but identifying specific strong associations during certain epidemic phases. Mobility's impact on case growth diminishes in later stages of the outbreak.
