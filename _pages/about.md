I am a roboticist currently working as a <strong>graduate research assistant</strong> at the <strong>Robotic Systems Lab</strong>, ETH Zurich. I obtained my MSc. in <strong>Robotics, Systems and Control</strong> at <strong>ETH Zurich</strong> in 2024. My interests lie in various aspects of field robotics with a particular focus on <strong>perception for robots</strong>. I did my master's thesis at <strong>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</strong>, CA, USA working on <strong>traversability mapping</strong> for offroad environments. Prior to this I have worked on projects involving <strong>Neural implicit SLAM, high speed motion estimation, Collaborative Visual Inertial SLAM and Lidar guided Object detection</strong>. I have had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of sensors ranging from dynamic vision sensor (event camera), RGB/RGBD/Stereo cameras to LiDARs and IMUs. I have experience working on different robotic platforms including legged robots (ANYmal C, D), wheeled ground robots (Polaris RZR Dune Buggy, SuperMegaBot, Clearpath Husky UGV) and flying robots (quadcopters, hexacopters).
